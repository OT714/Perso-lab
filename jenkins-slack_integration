Integrating Slack with Jenkins allows you to receive real-time notifications and updates about your Jenkins builds and jobs directly 
in your Slack workspace. Here are the step-by-step instructions to integrate Slack with Jenkins:

Step 1: Install the Slack Plugin in Jenkins

Open Jenkins and navigate to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Plugins" > "Available" tab.
Search for "Slack Notification Plugin" and select the checkbox next to it.
Click on the "Install without restart" button to install the plugin.
Step 2: Set Up Slack Incoming Webhook

In your Slack workspace, go to "Settings & administration" > "Manage apps" > "Browse apps."
Search for "Incoming Webhooks" and click on "Add to Slack."
Follow the prompts to configure the Incoming Webhook for your desired channel. Take note of the generated Webhook URL.
Step 3: Configure Jenkins Global Settings

Go back to Jenkins and navigate to "Manage Jenkins" > "Configure System."
Scroll down to the "Slack" section.
Click on "Add Slack Team Configuration" to set up your Slack team.
Enter a name for your Slack team configuration.
Paste the Slack Incoming Webhook URL obtained in Step 2 into the "Integration Token" field.
Optionally, you can customize the notification settings (e.g., notification events, message format, etc.).
Click on "Save" to save the configuration.
Step 4: Configure Jenkins Job to Send Slack Notifications

Open the Jenkins job that you want to receive notifications for or create a new job.
In the job configuration page, scroll down to the "Post-build Actions" section.
Click on "Add post-build action" and select "Slack Notifications" from the dropdown.
In the "Team" field, select the Slack team configuration you set up in Step 3.
Customize the notification settings for this specific job (e.g., channel, message, notification on success/failure, etc.).
Click on "Save" to save the job configuration.
Step 5: Test the Integration

Trigger a build in the Jenkins job you configured in Step 4.
After the build completes, check the Slack channel you specified in the Slack notification settings.
You should receive a notification in the Slack channel about the build status.
